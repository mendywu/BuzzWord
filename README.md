# BuzzWord!
BuzzWord is based off the popular Boggle word game. This version of the game is played with a 4x4 grid, filled with randomized letters, in which the player identifies words horizontally and/or diagonally fitting to the mode. 

There are currently only four playable modes: FOOD, ANIMALS, NAMES, and DICTIONARY. Below is a screenshot of the gameplay in DICTIONARY mode.

Each player is asked to log in or to create a profile when starting the game. Their progress is saved after passing each level, where the requirements to succeed gets relatively harder. 

<i>This game is made while in employment of Professuar - a fictional company designed for the students of Stony Brook's CSE219 course in Fall 2016. It uses the JavaFX Framework and the jackson library for ease in UI implementation and file manipulation. </i>
